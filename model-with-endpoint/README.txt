Instruction for the excercises 

1. For the first excercise:
 a- I prepare first a jupyther notebook for data visualization (DataVisualization).
 b- Then I create the model, test  and save it for the endpoint (ModelCreation).
2. I Created the endpoint using flask (endpoint.py). You should run it with 'python run endpoint.py' to start the local server.
3. I wrote a notebook to make the request (MakeRequest). So execute it when the server is already started. 

I know the model can be improbed, but I think the objective of the homework is showing all the stack from creation to publication.

Please if you have any doubt do not hesitate to contact me.
